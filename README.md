Project 
I followed along with this article and had fun, didn't take long it was
pretty cool, so crazy how little code it takes to make something so cool.


Refferences

This sight is great for a refference, it was easy, simple and fun to follow along. Big Shout out to 
Tola Agboola for the documentation. This was awesome to look at.

Button CSS

Not gonna lie, this was pretty cool to play around with, 
I recommend everyone to use this if they want to make their own button without having to flip back and forth from screens
